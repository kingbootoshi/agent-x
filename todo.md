to do:

i have to modularize existing cypher genesis components, specifically database, memories, notes, & twitter- make the rest custom
- add twitter commands as a tool, 
- add note taking as a tool, add notes, view notes (vd query), edit notes, delete notes
- add memories/summaries and clean it up to be more exact
- clean up TL summarizer agent to be more exact
- modularize database?

twitter commands:
- get-mentions returns exact list of mentions (10 max)
- get-homepage returns (10 tweets from homepage)
- get

problems that could fix everything
- 5/3/1 summaries for present is too vague. switch to a more precise, exact 3/2/1 summary method
- make summaries more exact, specific, and highlight the actions satoshi did and HOW he interacted with the world and WHAT the result was
- load in much less memories
- let satoshi take notes and reference notes when loading in memories (or when he wants to find them himself)
