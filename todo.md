# TO DO

## CORE UPDATES TO ADD:
- add gemini to baseagent
- add gemini to terminal agent
- add agent vision to agents without vision tech by routing the image to a vision model, get back detailed text, and feed back to agent
- add orchestrator agent & agent grouping process
- add an inbox feature to the terminal core, so proxy agents can send messages to the terminal core and the terminal core can send messages to the proxy agents

## FEATURES TO ADD:
- add note taking as a feature, add notes, view notes, edit notes, delete notes
- add memories as a feature, tapped into cloud memory
- add talking to another AI as a feature, like exo-query claude 
- add meme gen as a feature
- add bitcoin wallet/inscribing functionality as a feature

## QoL UPDATES TO ADD:
- make the core terminal personality something easy to configure 
- make the .yaml process easier, have the new agent initilization take a .yaml in code or optional from a file

the goal is to create a AI computer system that has new seeds daily so everyday is unique. the art is in the unknown of what the ai will do today, and how the ai grows overtime

### LOOK INTO:
- turning the terminalLoop into a terminal agent itself with tools
(not really needed, if talking to another AI is a feature? that counst as a seed)
