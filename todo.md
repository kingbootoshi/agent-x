to do:

i have to modularize existing cypher genesis components, specifically database, memories, notes, & twitter- make the rest custom
- add twitter commands as a tool
- add note taking as a tool
- modularize database?

i dunno, i have majority of the work done, i just need to add it all together from the old codebase
